These are the outputs for parameters amongst the final choices - after I filtered through and worked towards these ranges and kernels.

If you want to see these as they would be 'in their normal habitat', it suffices to copy/move the files from this directory to the root ragniroc directory - one level up from here.
(Should I have put these all in a single output to begin with? Yes. Did I? No. Why? Let's call it artistic freedom...)

What was used for this?

Well, simply `interp.py` was edited to have the following inputs (which are the defaults in the repository at the time of writing this):

epsilons   = np.linspace(0.5, 5.0, 10)
smoothings = np.logspace(-1, 0, 10)
kernels    = ['gaussian']
min_neigh  = 4
max_neigh  = 6

You can tinker with these values for different results and outputs. A summary of the results outputs (which are currently a little messy - again, 'artistic freedom'..) are given in the standard README
